								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I am Gareth N &#8211; a SQL Server DBA in the UK. I have started to blog over at <a href="https://ifexists.blog">ifexists.blog</a> &#8211; today I want to share some information around how dbatools can cache connection information, and how to reset it.</p>
<p>dbatools is smart. It can do things in the background when you&#8217;re using the commands, like cache connections and also cache the results of those connections. This can help speed things up as it will re-use the existing object.</p>
<p>But what if something changed since it cached the connection? Let’s see how we can edit the existing connections if necessary.</p>
<h3>My scenario</h3>
<p>I was updating some dev instances using what has to be one of my favorite commands, <a href="/Update-DbaInstance">Update-DbaInstance</a>. Here&#8217;s what my command looked like:</p>
<pre class="lang:ps decode:true ">Update-DbaInstance -ComputerName devbox1.domain.local -Restart -Path "\\fileshare\sql updates" -Credential ad\gareth</pre>
<p>For anyone new to dbatools, let’s briefly talk about what this is doing for us based on this example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prompt us for <code>ad\gareth</code>&#8216;s password</li>
<li>Find all SQL Server instances on devbox1</li>
<li>Search fileshare &#8220;\fileshare\sql updates&#8221; for updates relevant to any instances we found</li>
<li>If a Windows restart is required before installing patches, then restart</li>
<li>Prompt the user to install patches for any instances that were found and need updating</li>
<li>Finally, it will restart the computer after patching</li>
</ul>
<p>Works like a charm! For more details and examples, you can check out the <a href="https://docs.dbatools.io/#Update-DbaInstance">Update-DbaInstance help page</a>.</p>
<h4>Back on topic</h4>
<p>I came to update one instance, and my credentials were not working, I received an Access Denied message in PowerShell. I did what was necessary to get my permissions added on the windows server, confident I was good to go I tried again, but still no luck. This time the error was slightly different, “Windows authentication was used, but is known to not work!”. Hmmm, not sure what this means? I went off to the dbatools slack channel for advice and got the answer I needed.</p>
<p>dbatools was showing me this message because I recently tried to access this server and it knows I didn’t have permission, it remembered and wasn’t going to waste time trying again. But now I do have permission, so I do actually need it to forget and try again, to do that we use <code>Set-DbaCmConnection</code>.</p>
<pre class="lang:ps decode:true ">Set-DbaCmConnection -ComputerName devbox1.domain.local -ResetCredential -ResetConnectionStatus -DisableBadCredentialCache</pre>
<p>This will give us a fresh start with this server and cause dbatools to try and authenticate again, resulting in a good connection object. Also using the -DisableBadCredentialCache flag we can stop it from caching bad credentials while we debug our access issues.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.dbatools.io/#Set-DbaCmConnection">Set-DbaCmConnection help page</a> for further information.</p>
